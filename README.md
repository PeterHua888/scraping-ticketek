# scraping-ticketek
## Purpose of this repo
The tickets for Jay Chou concert in Sydney was sold out soon after the release.
However, there is evidence that tickets are release on Ticketek intermittently.
With my experience in software development and frontend development, I am 
motivated to create a web scraping app to check if there is release promptly. 
The motivation comes from firstly, the possibility of getting the tickets for
my partner and myself, who are Jay Chou's fans but haven't ever watched his live
concerts; and secondly, the opportunity to learn and apply web scraping skills
to solve an interesting real world problem
